AI-Powered Recruiting Outreach Platform

Project Overview

Helix is a prototype AI-powered recruiting outreach platform that helps recruiters create personalized outreach sequences through a chat-driven interface. The application features a split-screen design with an interactive AI chat on the left and a dynamic workspace for editing sequences on the right.
Current Implementation Status

Completed Features

Frontend

    React-based frontend with TypeScript implementation
    Split-screen layout with chat interface and workspace
    Real-time communication with backend using WebSocket
    Basic message history and conversation flow
    Dynamic sequence display in workspace
    Basic styling and responsive design

Backend

    Flask server with WebSocket support using Flask-SocketIO
    Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 using LangChain
    Basic conversation memory implementation
    SQLite database integration for chat history storage
    CORS support for local development

Database

    SQLite implementation with basic schema for chat history
    Storage of session ID, user messages, and AI responses
    Timestamp tracking for messages

Technical Architecture

    [User Browser] <--WebSocket--> [Flask Backend] <---> [LangChain/GPT-4]
       |                             |
       |                             |
   [React UI] <---------------> [SQLite DB]

Frontend Stack

    React + TypeScript
    Socket.io-client for real-time communication
    Component-based architecture with ChatBar and Workspace components

Backend Stack

    Flask
    Flask-SocketIO
    LangChain with OpenAI integration
    SQLite3 for database
    Python environment with necessary dependencies

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a .env file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key:
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

3. Backend Setup:
    pip install flask flask-socketio flask-cors python-dotenv langchain-openai
    python app.py

4. Frontend Setup:
    npm install
    npm start


The application should now be running on localhost:3000 with the backend on port 5000.
